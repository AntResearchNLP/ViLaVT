Continuing to rotate, you can see Figure 4, then Figure 2, then Figure 3, and finally Figure 1. At this point, Figure 1 is also equivalent to rotating 60 degrees to the right from the starting position of Figure 5.\n3. Rotating Figure 5 by 180 degrees corresponds to Figure 2, so it is most likely that the content in Figure 2 will be seen, because the chair photographed in Figure 5 is also almost directly facing this door.",

Therefore, the area occupied by the sofa is: 3.38.\n\n2. From Figure 2, it can be seen that the width of the area between the two sofas is about 1.5 to 2 times the width of the sofa, which is approximately 2 to 2.6. Therefore, the area occupied by the middle region is 2.6 * 2 = 5.2, up to 2.6 * 2.6 = 6.76.\n\n3. Therefore, the total area occupied is: 3.38 * 2 + 5.2 or 6.76, which is 12 to 13.5 square units.\n\n4.

Using the height of the wall outside the balcony as a reference, in Figure 6, the top of the bedside lamp is estimated to be about ten centimeters below the wall height, and the top of the lamp next to the white lounge chair is estimated to be about twenty centimeters below the wall height.\n4. There is a mirror right at the entrance of the bathroom. In the mirror, you can see that the switch inside the bathroom is on the wall opposite the mirror, so the switch inside the bathroom is closer to the bed than the sink is.",
